Anomaly Transformer: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Association Discrepancy

Unsupervised detection of anomaly points in time series is a challenging problem, which requires the model to learn informative representation and derive a distinguishable criterion. In this paper, we propose the Anomaly Transformer in these three folds:

- An inherent distinguishable criterion as **Association Discrepancy** for detection.
- A new **Anomaly-Attention** mechanism to compute the association discrepancy.
- A **minimax strategy** to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy.

## Get Started

1. Install Python 3.6, PyTorch >= 1.4.0. 

3. Train and evaluate. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results as follows:
```bash
bash ./scripts/SMD.sh
bash ./scripts/MSL.sh
bash ./scripts/SMAP.sh
bash ./scripts/PSM.sh
```



## Main Result

We compare our model with 15 baselines, including THOC, InterFusion, etc. **Generally,  Anomaly-Transformer achieves SOTA.**
